            <h2 class="section-title">What is EMDR Therapy?</h2>
            <p><strong>EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing)</strong> is a powerful, evidence-based therapy that helps your brain heal from traumatic experiences. Developed by Dr. Francine Shapiro in 1987, EMDR has helped millions of people worldwide find relief from trauma, anxiety, and distressing memories.</p>
            
            <p>Unlike traditional talk therapy, EMDR doesn't require you to talk in detail about the traumatic event or complete homework between sessions. Instead, it uses bilateral stimulation — typically guided eye movements — to help your brain naturally process and integrate difficult memories, reducing their emotional charge.</p>
            
            <p>Think of it like this: When you cut your hand, your body knows how to heal the wound. But if something keeps irritating the cut, it can't heal properly. EMDR removes the block that's keeping your brain from healing, allowing natural recovery to occur.</p>
