            <h1>5 Practical Coping Strategies for Anxiety You Can Use Today</h1>
        </div>
    </header>

    <article class="blog-content">
        <p>Anxiety can feel overwhelming, but there are practical, evidence-based strategies you can start using right now to find relief. As a therapist with over 22 years of experience treating anxiety, I've seen these techniques help countless clients regain a sense of control.</p>

        <h2>1. The 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique</h2>
        <p>When anxiety spikes, your mind races into the future with "what ifs." Grounding brings you back to the present moment, where you're actually safe.</p>
        
        <div class="strategy-box">
            <h4>How to Practice:</h4>
            <p>Notice and name:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>5 things you can see</strong> — Look around and identify five visual details</li>
                <li><strong>4 things you can touch</strong> — Feel textures around you</li>
                <li><strong>3 things you can hear</strong> — Listen for sounds in your environment</li>
                <li><strong>2 things you can smell</strong> — Notice any scents</li>
                <li><strong>1 thing you can taste</strong> — What taste is in your mouth?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>2. Box Breathing</h2>
        <p>When you're anxious, your breathing becomes shallow and rapid, which actually intensifies anxiety. Box breathing activates your parasympathetic nervous system — your body's natural calm-down response.</p>
        
        <div class="strategy-box">
            <h4>How to Practice:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Breathe IN for 4 counts</li>
                <li>HOLD for 4 counts</li>
                <li>Breathe OUT for 4 counts</li>
                <li>HOLD for 4 counts</li>
                <li>Repeat 4-6 times</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This technique is used by Navy SEALs to stay calm under pressure — it works.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>3. Challenge the "What If"</h2>
        <p>Anxiety loves to play the "what if" game. <em>What if I fail? What if they judge me? What if something terrible happens?</em></p>
        <p>The key is to challenge these thoughts with evidence and realistic alternatives.</p>
        
        <div class="strategy-box">
            <h4>Ask Yourself:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>What evidence do I have that this will actually happen?</li>
                <li>What's the most realistic outcome (not worst case)?</li>
                <li>If it did happen, could I cope with it?</li>
                <li>Have I handled difficult situations before?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>4. Schedule Worry Time</h2>
        <p>This might sound counterintuitive, but designating specific "worry time" can actually reduce overall anxiety. Instead of trying to suppress anxious thoughts (which doesn't work), you postpone them.</p>
        
        <div class="strategy-box">
            <h4>How to Practice:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Choose a 15-minute window each day (not before bed)</li>
                <li>When worries arise during the day, write them down and tell yourself: "I'll think about that during worry time"</li>
                <li>During your scheduled time, review and address the worries</li>
                <li>When the timer goes off, stop and move on</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Many people find that by the time worry time arrives, the concerns have lost their urgency.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>5. Progressive Muscle Relaxation</h2>
        <p>Anxiety lives in the body as much as the mind. Tension headaches, tight shoulders, clenched jaw — these physical symptoms feed back into the anxiety cycle. Progressive muscle relaxation breaks that cycle.</p>
        
        <div class="strategy-box">
            <h4>How to Practice:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Start with your feet — tense the muscles tightly for 5 seconds</li>
                <li>Release and notice the difference between tension and relaxation</li>
                <li>Move up to your calves, thighs, stomach, chest, hands, arms, shoulders, and face</li>
                <li>Tense each muscle group for 5 seconds, then release</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Practice daily, especially before bed, to reduce baseline anxiety levels.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>When to Seek Professional Help</h2>
        <p>These strategies are powerful tools, but they're not a substitute for professional treatment if your anxiety is significantly impacting your life. Consider reaching out to a therapist if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Anxiety interferes with work, relationships, or daily activities</li>
            <li>You're avoiding situations because of fear</li>
            <li>You experience panic attacks</li>
            <li>Self-help strategies aren't providing enough relief</li>
            <li>Anxiety has lasted more than a few weeks</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Evidence-based treatments like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) are highly effective for anxiety disorders. You don't have to keep struggling alone.</p>
